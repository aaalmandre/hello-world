A number is called lucky if it consists only of digits 4 and 7. For example, 44, 747, 4 are lucky numbers, and 745, 423, 111 are not. Your task is to find the smallest lucky number in range [L, R] , and if there is none you should return -1.

 
Example: For L = 1 and R = 2 the output should be -1. For L = 4 and R = 7 the output should be 4.

 

Input 1 (L) → integer :
0 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^5

Input 2 (R) → integer :
Output → integer :
The smallest lucky number from the given range.
